	<p>Upgrading <em>Carte Noir/Blanc</em> is an absolute must for any Phantom. Crit rate is important for every class, but especially for Phantoms. Carte is triggered upon every crit hit, and will very often be near 50% of your damage when bossing with Mille and Tempest. </p>
	<p><em>Mille Aiguilles</em> is your main bossing skill, as this skill applies an extra 20% IED. The damage% scaling may be low, but this is made up for with the amount of lines you can output compared to any other class. In effect, small increases in range will increase your damage output with Mille more than expected, as each increase is multiplied by 3 (Mille has 3 "cycles").</p>
	<p><em>Tempest</em> is a very nice AOE key-down skill. If you don't have max crit rate, don't worry - Tempest is guaranteed 100% crit with each hit, meaning Carte is triggered with every hit. </p>

	<p>Quick Phantom Overview</p>
	<p>Phantom is one of six Maple World Heroes. Barring Freud and Shade, Phantom and the other Heroes were cursed and trapped in ice for hundreds of years, effectively in cryostasis. Phantom, along with the other Heroes, have awoken to help take down the Black Mage once and for all. </p>
	<p>Known as history's master thief, Phantom is a charming man who steals both treasure and ladies' hearts. Of course, as Maple World's best thief, Phantom isn't limited to simple treasures - Phantom can swipe many skills from the Explorer class to use for his own, granting him extremely high versatility for various playstyles. </p>
	<p>Of course, a great thief must have a great getaway. This class is equipped with a double flash jump and a 3-use near-instantaneous teleport. Being incredibly rich beyond belief, Phantom owns a personal airship - and if you play Phantom, so do you. </p>
