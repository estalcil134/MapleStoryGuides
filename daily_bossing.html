	<h2>Gollux</h2>
	<p><b>Consists of 3 phases</b></p>
	<p>There are also sub-parts of Gollux that you may kill to lower the difficulty of the battle (a total of 3 sub-parts). Kill none, and the battle will be Hell. Kill one, and the battle will be Hard. Kill two, and the battle will be Normal. Kill all three, and the battle will be Easy.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>All Phases</i>
			<ul>
				<li>In all phases, his potatoes will slowly move towards the center bottom, towards the Jaw. Once a potato reaches the center, a counter will increment on top of your head. Once the counter reaches 5, you will die (this bypasses any iframes and death prevention measures). Death in any form will reset the counter to 0.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>Jaw</i>
			<ul>
				<li>The Jaw is located in the center bottom of the map. Here, you should stay in the center and attack while moving slightly to cross back and forth between the center.</li>
				<li>This is because Gollux will unleash various breath attacks (most of them are 1HKO), but he will only target one side at a time. By staying in the center, you can quickly move to the other side to avoid the breath.</li>
				<li>Occasionally, his hands will come up and try to crush you. The attack will only apply if you are within the targeted area by the time the hand lands on the ground. A single flashjump or so is sufficient to avoid the hand.</li>
				<li>If you kill the stomach beforehand, Gollux will not use breath attacks (this lowers the difficulty of the battle and the quality of the rewards). If you kill the both shoulders beforehand, Gollux will not use his hands to attack (this lowers the difficulty of the battle and the quality of the rewards).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>Eyes</i>
			<ul>
				<li>As soon as the Jaw phase is complete, an upper platform will appear by the Eyes. A portal will appear in the center of the floor to teleport up to the upper platform.</li>
				<li>There will be various blasts from the Eyes which will deal damage and knock you back and off the platform. The blast can be avoided by being slightly behind the portals on the top platform.</li>
				<li>Once again, hands will come up to try to crush you. It is much easier to dodge them here. To avoid damage, all you have to do is duck.</li>
				<li>If you kill the both shoulders beforehand, Gollux will not use his hands to attack (this lowers the difficulty of the battle and the quality of the rewards).</li>
				<li>For some classes, this may be a tough phase as the potatoes appear on the platform below them.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>Gem</i>
			<ul>
				<li>Once the Eyes are defeated, the portals near you can be taken to the forehead, where the Gem resides.</li>
				<li>This phase is simply a DPS check. There will once again be various blasts, but they serve only to knock you back and do minimal/negligible damage.</li>
				<li>The potatoes are still here, so this may be a tough phase if you barely have enough DPS to kill the Gem. If you have enough DPS, the potatoes may be ignored completely.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Main Rewards: Gollux Belt, Gollux Pendant</p>
