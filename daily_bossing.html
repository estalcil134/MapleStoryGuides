	<h1>Daily Bossing Guide</h1>
	<h2>Zakum - Easy/Normal</h2>
	<p>Super simple. Avoid the marks on the floor where the arms will fall.</p>
	<p>Kill the arms for EXP, then Zakum itself.</p>
	<p>Rewards are mainly from Normal difficulty. Chaos is not worthwhile to do/attempt.</p>
	<p>Main Rewards: Eye Accessory, Face Accessory, EXP</p>
	<h2>Hilla - Normal/Hard</h2>
	<p>Attacks</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Damage Reflect</li>
		<li>Full Map Attack (FMA): There are a few seconds to activate iframes or such before the attack hits. You can also be shielded from the blast by a certain barrier that will appear on the map.</li>
		<li>Tombstones: The tombstones which drop will deal %HP damage. Avoid them if you can.</li>
		<li>Magnet Tower: Hilla summons a tower which forcibly warps players into itself. Damage dealt is minimal, but the real damage is dealt in the loss of positioning. The tower must be killed for the effects to wear off. </li>
		<li><i>Hard only:</i> Hilla will randomly cage a party member and start draining their health. (Note that is it more similar to a regeneration effect, as she heals a constant amount regardless of the HP of the caged party member.) To stop the regeneration, the caged party member may be freed by basic attacking the cage. Once the timer of the cage is done, the caged party member dies and Hilla's regeneration stops. The summoning of the cage may be blocked by iframes, but death by cage bypasses iframes and death prevention methods. Essentially, this is her anti-burst measure as she heals a significant amount of HP and even if she were to be binded, the regeneration still goes on. There is no way to resist caging, except by iframes when she summons the cage. There is no set pattern to her caging: she may summon it in the beginning, at low HP, at high HP, or not at all. She may also summon the cage multiple times per battle, with a higher tendency when she has lower HP.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Magnus - Easy/Normal</h2>
	<p><b>Important</b> - Magnus' Zone: There will constantly be a light blue "zone" around Magnus. Throughout the battle, you must stay in this zone. Being outside means you take intermittent damage, and damage you deal is reduced by 50%. The zone decreases in size as Magnus' HP goes down.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Meteors: Meteors are constantly falling in the throne room. They come in 3 sizes: small, medium, and large, and they correspond in their size and damage dealt (small deals lighter damage and is faster, while large is the biggest, slowest, and most dangerous). If you are a thief, Dark Sight can negate the damage of the meteors, but increases the cooldown of Dark Sight once you come out of it. Meteors fall more frequesntly as Magnus' HP falls.</li>
		<li>Magnus Dash: Magnus charges for half a second, then rushes left/right, effectively leaving you behind and possibly out of the zone.</li>
		<li>Lightning: Magnus will summon yellow magic circles which strike down a bolt of lightning after a few seconds. Magnus can move after summoning the circles. The width of the lightning bolt is about as wide as the circle itself, so avoiding it is more difficult than it might seem.</li>
		<li>Knockback Spin: After charging for half a second, Magnus spins around and applies heavy knockback to all players within range (knockback cannot be resisted). This becomes more and more dangerous as the zone shrinks.</li>
		<li>Ground Blast: Magnus leaps into the air and charges his blade for a few seconds. Once the blade changes form, he lunges downward and strikes the ground, creating a shockwave that deals a lot of damage.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Main Rewards: Nova Gear, Royal Black Shoulder</p>
	<h2>Ranmaru</h2>
	<p>You can do both Easy and Madman in one day.</p>
	<p>This boss is quite simple. Just watch out for his damage reflect.</p>
	<p>Main Rewards: Confusion Fragment(s), Japanese Weapon/Armor Recipes</p>
	<h2>Arkarium</h2>
	<p>Main Rewards: Primal Essence(s)</p>
	<h2>Gollux</h2>
	<p><b>Consists of 3 phases</b></p>
	<p>There are also sub-parts of Gollux that you may kill to lower the difficulty of the battle (a total of 3 sub-parts). Kill none, and the battle will be Hell. Kill one, and the battle will be Hard. Kill two, and the battle will be Normal. Kill all three, and the battle will be Easy.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>All Phases</i>
			<ul>
				<li>In all phases, his potatoes will slowly move towards the center bottom, towards the Jaw. Once a potato reaches the center, a counter will increment on top of your head. Once the counter reaches five, you will die (this bypasses any iframes and death prevention measures). Death in any form will reset the counter to 0. The potatoes have minimal health and are easy to kill, so don't let the counter reach five!. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>Jaw</i>
			<ul>
				<li>The Jaw is located in the center bottom of the map. Here, you should stay in the center and attack while moving slightly to cross back and forth between the center.</li>
				<li>This is because Gollux will unleash various breath attacks (most of them are 1HKO), but he will only target one side at a time. By staying in the center, you can quickly move to the other side to avoid the breath.</li>
				<li>Occasionally, his hands will come up and try to crush you. The attack will only apply if you are within the targeted area by the time the hand lands on the ground. A single flashjump or so is sufficient to avoid the hand.</li>
				<li>If you kill the stomach beforehand, Gollux will not use breath attacks (this lowers the difficulty of the battle and the quality of the rewards). If you kill the both shoulders beforehand, Gollux will not use his hands to attack (this lowers the difficulty of the battle and the quality of the rewards).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>Eyes</i>
			<ul>
				<li>As soon as the Jaw phase is complete, an upper platform will appear by the Eyes. A portal will appear in the center of the floor to teleport up to the upper platform.</li>
				<li>There will be various blasts from the Eyes which will deal damage and knock you back and off the platform. The blast can be avoided by being slightly behind the portals on the top platform.</li>
				<li>Once again, hands will come up to try to crush you. It is much easier to dodge them here. To avoid damage, all you have to do is duck.</li>
				<li>If you kill the both shoulders beforehand, Gollux will not use his hands to attack (this lowers the difficulty of the battle and the quality of the rewards).</li>
				<li>For some classes, this may be a tough phase as the potatoes appear on the platform below them.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>Gem</i>
			<ul>
				<li>Once the Eyes are defeated, the portals near you can be taken to the forehead, where the Gem resides.</li>
				<li>This phase is simply a DPS check. There will once again be various blasts, but they serve only to knock you back and do minimal/negligible damage.</li>
				<li>The potatoes are still here, so this may be a tough phase if you barely have enough DPS to kill the Gem. If you have enough DPS, the potatoes may be ignored completely.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
